    "Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. There are many different ways to perform web scraping to obtain data from websites. These include using online services, particular API’s or even creating your code for web scraping from scratch. Many large websites, like Google, Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, etc. have API’s that allow you to access their data in a structured format. This is the best option, but there are other sites that don’t allow users to access large amounts of data in a structured form or they are simply not that technologically advanced. In that situation, it’s best to use Web Scraping to scrape the website for data.\n",

    "Three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data :-\n",
    "1. Price Monitoring:- Web Scraping can be used by companies to scrap the product data for their products and competing products as well to see how it impacts their pricing strategies. Companies can use this data to fix the optimal pricing for their products so that they can obtain maximum revenue.\n",
    "2. News Monitoring:- Web scraping news sites can provide detailed reports on the current news to a company. This is even more essential for companies that are frequently in the news or that depend on daily news for their day-to-day functioning. After all, news reports can make or break a company in a single day!\n",
    "3. Email Marketing:- Companies can also use Web scraping for email marketing. They can collect Email ID’s from various sites using web scraping and then send bulk promotional and marketing Emails to all the people owning these Email ID’s."

    "1. Human Copy-and-Paste:- Manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet is the most basic form of web scraping. Even the best web-scraping technology cannot always replace a human’s manual examination and copy-and-paste, and this may be the only viable option when the websites for scraping explicitly prohibit machine automation.\n",
    "2. Computer Vision Web-Page Analysis:- There are efforts using machine learning and computer vision to identify and extract information from web pages by visually interpreting pages as a human would.\n",
    "3. Semantic Annotation Recognizing:- The scraped pages may include metadata, semantic markups, and annotations that can be used to locate specific data snippets. This technique can be viewed as a subset of DOM parsing if the annotations are embedded in the pages, as Microformat does. In another case, the annotations are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.\n",
    "4. HTML Parsing:-Many websites contain large collections of pages that are dynamically generated from an underlying structured source, such as a database. A common script or template is typically used to encode data from the same category into similar pages. A wrapper is a program in data mining that detects such templates in a specific information source, extracts its content, and converts it to a relational form. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that the input pages of a wrapper induction system follow a common template and can be identified using a URL common scheme. semi-structured data query languages such as XQuery and HTQL can be used to parse HTML pages as well as retrieve and transform page content.\n"

In other words, one way to collect, organize and analyze this enormous amount of data is through web scraping."

    "Flask is a popular web framework in Python that is often used for building web applications and APIs. While Flask is primarily known for its capabilities in web development, it can also be utilized in web scraping projects for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lightweight and flexible: Flask is a lightweight framework that provides the essential tools and features needed to build web applications. Its simplicity makes it easy to use and allows developers to focus on specific requirements of the project, such as web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Routing and URL handling: Flask provides a routing mechanism that maps URLs to specific functions, allowing you to define the endpoints of your web scraping application. This enables you to define different routes for handling various scraping tasks, such as fetching data from different websites or processing different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Template rendering: Flask includes a built-in templating engine that allows you to generate dynamic HTML content. In a web scraping project, this can be useful for presenting the scraped data in a user-friendly format or generating reports based on the extracted information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Request handling: Web scraping involves making HTTP requests to retrieve web pages and extract data. Flask provides convenient methods for handling incoming requests, allowing you to initiate and manage HTTP requests easily within your scraping project.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Integration with other Python libraries: Flask seamlessly integrates with other Python libraries, making it straightforward to incorporate popular web scraping tools like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy into your Flask-based project. This allows you to leverage the power of these libraries for parsing and extracting data from HTML or XML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deployment and scalability: Flask provides a simple development server for testing purposes, but it can also be deployed on various production environments, such as Apache or Nginx. This makes it possible to scale your web scraping application and handle multiple requests concurrently if needed."
